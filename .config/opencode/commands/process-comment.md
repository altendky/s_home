# Process GitHub PR Review Comment

**Comment reference:** $1

## Process

1. **Validate and parse the input:**
   - If the input contains `/issues/` → **stop** and inform the user: "This appears to be an issue URL, not a PR review comment. Use `/process-issue` instead."
   - If the input contains `/pull/` but does NOT contain `#discussion_r`, `/files#r`, or `#r` → **stop** and inform the user: "This appears to be a PR URL without a comment reference. Use `/review-pr` to review the PR, or provide a specific comment URL (e.g., ending in `#discussion_r1234567890`)."
   - If given a URL like `https://github.com/owner/repo/pull/123#discussion_r1234567890` or `https://github.com/owner/repo/pull/123/files#r1234567890`, extract the comment ID (the number after `r`)
   - If given just a comment ID number, use it directly

2. **Fetch the comment and full thread:**
   - Determine the repository owner/repo from the URL or from `gh repo view --json owner,name`
   - Fetch the linked comment: `gh api repos/{owner}/{repo}/pulls/comments/{comment_id}`
   - Extract the PR number from the comment's `pull_request_url` field
   - Fetch all review comments for the PR: `gh api repos/{owner}/{repo}/pulls/{pull_number}/comments --paginate`
   - Build the thread:
     - If the linked comment has an `in_reply_to_id`, that value is the root comment's ID
     - If the linked comment has no `in_reply_to_id`, it is the root
     - Collect the root comment and all comments where `in_reply_to_id` equals the root's `id`

3. **Check thread status:**
   - Check if the thread is resolved using:

     ```graphql
     gh api graphql -f query='
       query($owner: String!, $repo: String!, $pr: Int!) {
         repository(owner: $owner, name: $repo) {
           pullRequest(number: $pr) {
             reviewThreads(first: 100) {
               pageInfo { hasNextPage endCursor }
               nodes {
                 isResolved
                 comments(first: 1) {
                   nodes { databaseId }
                 }
               }
             }
           }
         }
       }
     ' -f owner={owner} -f repo={repo} -F pr={pull_number}
     ```

     Match the root comment's ID against `databaseId` to find the thread. If the root comment's ID is not found among the returned threads, check `reviewThreads.pageInfo.hasNextPage`. If `true`, re-run the query with an `after: "<endCursor>"` argument on `reviewThreads` to fetch the next page. Repeat until the thread is found or all threads have been checked.
   - If `isResolved` is `true`, inform the user: "This comment thread is marked as resolved. It may have already been addressed." Ask if they want to proceed anyway or stop.
   - Check if the comment is outdated by comparing the comment's `commit_id` field (from step 2) against the PR's current head commit (`headRefOid` from `gh pr view {pull_number} --json headRefOid`). If they differ, inform the user: "This comment was made against commit `<short-sha>` but the PR head is now `<short-sha>` — the referenced code may have changed." Ask if they want to proceed.
   - If neither condition applies, continue silently.

4. **Verify branch:**
   - Get the PR's head branch using the PR number from step 2: `HEAD_BRANCH=$(gh pr view "$PR_NUMBER" --json headRefName --jq '.headRefName')`
   - Get current local branch: `CURRENT_BRANCH=$(git branch --show-current)`
   - Compare `HEAD_BRANCH` and `CURRENT_BRANCH`; if they don't match, inform the user and **stop**

5. **Understand the feedback:**
   - Read the entire thread to understand the full context of the discussion
   - Pay special attention to the specifically linked comment—it may indicate:
     - The most recent or relevant feedback to address
     - A specific decision or direction the user wants to be implemented
     - A follow-up request after earlier discussion
   - If the thread contains back-and-forth discussion, identify the current consensus or latest request
   - Note the file path and line range from the root comment's `path`, `line`, and `start_line` fields
   - Many review comments (especially from CodeRabbit) include a "Prompt for AI Agents" section—check all comments in the thread for such prompts

6. **Research the context:**
   - Read the relevant file(s) mentioned in the comment
   - Understand the surrounding code and its purpose
   - Check if the feedback is valid and applicable

7. **Present summary and confirm approach:**
   - Summarize the feedback: provide a concise synthesis of what the comment thread is about (e.g., "The reviewer requests that the error message include the file path for easier debugging")
   - Describe the intended resolution: explain the planned changes (e.g., "I will modify the `handle_error` function in `src/lib.rs` to include `path` in the formatted error string")
   - Provide the original comment URL for easy access to full context
   - **Pause and ask the user** if they would like to proceed, discuss the approach, or redirect

8. **Implement the fix:**
   - Make the requested changes following the comment's guidance
   - Ensure changes are consistent with the codebase style and conventions

9. **Summarize:**
   - Briefly describe what changes were made to address the comment

10. **Confirm with user:**
   - Show the changes made: run `git diff` to display all modifications
   - Ask if they are satisfied with the changes and would like to commit and push
   - If no, stop without committing (the changes remain in the working directory for manual review or further editing)

11. **Commit and push:**

    - Stage the changed files
    - Commit with message format:

      ```text
      review comment: <brief summary>

      <description of changes made to address the feedback>

      <comment-url>
      ```

    - Push to the remote branch

12. **Reply to the comment:**
    - Get the commit URL:
      - `COMMIT_SHA=$(git rev-parse HEAD)`
      - `REPO=$(gh repo view --json owner,name --jq '.owner.login + "/" + .name')`
      - Commit URL: `https://github.com/${REPO}/commit/${COMMIT_SHA}`
    - Draft a brief, conversational reply explaining what changes were made to address the feedback, including a link to the commit
    - Show the draft reply to the user and ask for confirmation before posting
    - If approved, post the reply:

      ```bash
      gh api repos/{owner}/{repo}/pulls/{pull_number}/comments \
        -f body="<reply text>" \
        -F in_reply_to={comment_id}
      ```

    - If not approved, skip posting (the commit is already pushed; user can reply manually if desired)
